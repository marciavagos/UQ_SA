However, its computational cost is extremely high, and, in many cases, prohibitive. Fortunately, the MC algorithm is easily parallelizable, which allows its use in simulations where the computation of a single realization is very costly. This work presents a methodology for the parallelization of the MC method, in the context of cloud computing. This strategy is based on the MapReduce paradigm, and allows an efficient distribution of tasks in the cloud. This methodology is illustrated on a problem of structural dynamics that is subject to uncertainties. The results show that the technique is capable of producing good results concerning statistical moments of low order. It is shown that even a simple problem may require many realizations for convergence of histograms, which makes the cloud computing strategy very attractive (due to its high scalability capacity and low-cost). Additionally, the results regarding the time of processing and storage space usage allow one to qualify this new methodology as a solution for simulations that require a number of MC realizations beyond the standard."

In the case of a single uncertainty a simple analytical relation exists among its the Probability Density Function (PDF) and the corresponding PDF for the output of the simulation: this allows a complete statistical analysis of the results of the simulation. We examine the extension of this result to the multi-variate case, when more than one of the physical input parameters are affected by uncertainties: a typical scenario is the prediction of the dependence of the simulation on input cross section tabulations.}

	abstract = {Abstract Computational models of the heart have reached a maturity level that render them useful for in silico studies of arrhythmia and other cardiac diseases. However, the translation to the clinic of cardiac simulations critically depends on demonstrating the accuracy, robustness, and reliability of the underlying computational models under the presence of uncertainties. In this work, we study for the first time the effect of parameter uncertainty on 2 state-of-the-art coupled models of excitation-contraction of cardiac tissue. To this end, we perform forward uncertainty propagation and sensitivity analyses to understand how variability in key maximal conductances affect selected quantities of interest, such as the action potential duration (APD90), maximum intracellular calcium concentration, cardiac stretch, and stress. Our results suggest a strong linear relationship between selected maximal conductances and quantities of interest for a variability in parameters up to 25\%, which justifies the construction of linear response surfaces that are used to compute the empirical probability density functions of all the quantities of interest under study. For both electromechanical models analyzed, uncertainty in the material parameters associated to the passive mechanical response of cardiac tissue does not affect the duration of action potentials, neither the amplitude of intracellular calcium concentrations. Our results confirm the poor mechanoelectric feedback that classical models of cardiac electromechanics have, even under the presence of parameter uncertainty.},,

We suggest that SA could considerably assist in the use of models, by providing objective criteria of judgement for different phases of the model-building process: model identification and discrimination; model calibration; model corroboration. We review some new global quantitative SA methods and suggest that these might enlarge the scope for sensitivity analysis in computational and statistical modeling practice. Among the advantages of the new methods are their robustness, model independence and computational convenience. The discussion is based on worked examples.},

One is the Fourier amplitude sensitivity test's coefficient, developed in the 1970s, and the other the Sobol' sensitivity indices, developed in the 1990s. Supposedly both methods are capable of computing the “main effect” contribution of model's input parameters to model's output variance. We discuss the equivalence of the two methods, and prove the identity of their prediction on two test cases. Relative advantage and disadvantages of the methods are also illustrated."

In three models of the ventricular action potential, parameters were randomized, repeated simulations were run, important outputs were calculated, and multivariable regression was performed on the collected results. Random parameters included both maximal rates of ion transport and gating variable characteristics. The procedure generated simplified, empirical models that predicted outputs resulting from new sets of input parameters. The linear regression models were quite accurate, despite nonlinearities in the mechanistic models. Moreover, the regression coefficients, which represent parameter sensitivities, were robust, even when parameters were varied over a wide range. Most importantly, a side-by-side comparison of two similar models identified fundamental differences in model behavior, and revealed model predictions that were both consistent with, and inconsistent with, experimental data. This new method therefore shows promise as a tool for the characterization and assessment of computational models. The general strategy may also suggest methods for integrating traditional quantitative models with large-scale data sets obtained using high-throughput technologies."

	abstract = {Author Summary Mathematical models of biological processes generally contain many free parameters that are not known from experiments. Choosing values for these parameters, although an important step in the construction of realistic computational models, is frequently performed using an ad hoc approach that is a combination of intuition and trial and error. We have developed a novel method for constraining free parameters in mathematical models based on the techniques of linear algebra. We demonstrate this method's utility through simulations with a model of a human heart cell. The underlying premise is that if the model is only asked to recapitulate one or a few biological behaviors, the values of the parameters may be ambiguous; however, if the model must simultaneously match many features of experimental data, the free parameters can be determined uniquely. The results demonstrate that if computational models are to be realistic, they must be compared with several sets of data at the same time. This new method should serve as a valuable tool for investigators interested in developing realistic mathematical models of biological processes.},

	abstract = {Aims Human atrial electrophysiology exhibits high inter-subject variability in both sinus rhythm (SR) and chronic atrial fibrillation (cAF) patients. Variability is however rarely investigated in experimental and theoretical electrophysiological studies, thus hampering the understanding of its underlying causes but also its implications in explaining differences in the response to disease and treatment. In our study, we aim at investigating the ability of populations of human atrial cell models to capture the inter-subject variability in action potential (AP) recorded in 363 patients both under SR and cAF conditions.  Methods and Results Human AP recordings in atrial trabeculae (n = 469) from SR and cAF patients were used to calibrate populations of computational SR and cAF atrial AP models. Three populations of over 2000 sampled models were generated, based on three different human atrial AP models. Experimental calibration selected populations of AP models yielding AP with morphology and duration in range with experimental recordings. Populations using the three original models can mimic variability in experimental AP in both SR and cAF, with median conductance values in SR for most ionic currents deviating less than 30% from their original peak values. All cAF populations show similar variations in GK1, GKur and Gto, consistent with AF-related remodeling as reported in experiments. In all SR and cAF model populations, inter-subject variability in IK1 and INaK underlies variability in APD90, variability in IKur, ICaL and INaK modulates variability in APD50 and combined variability in Ito and IKur determines variability in APD20. The large variability in human atrial AP triangulation is mostly determined by IK1 and either INaK or INaCa depending on the model.  Conclusion Experimentally-calibrated human atrial AP models populations mimic AP variability in SR and cAF patient recordings, and identify potential ionic determinants of inter-subject variability in human atrial AP duration and morphology in SR versus cAF.},

We developed and validated a computational model of signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (Stat3) pathway kinetics, a signaling network involved in mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC) self-renewal. Our analysis demonstrates that stem cell fate control is regulated by a distributed set of parameters that positively and negatively regulate Stat3 activation. We further demonstrate that we can take advantage of differences in the timing of signaling pathway activation and inhibition to design a strategy to deliver self-renewal stimuli to stem cells in a more efficient manner. Ultimately, the use of stem cells in biotechnological applications will require an in-depth understanding of how cells integrate diverse environmental stimuli to make cell fate decisions.},

	abstract = {Key points Mathematical and computational models of cardiac physiology have been an integral component of cardiac electrophysiology since its inception, and are collectively known as the Cardiac Physiome. We identify and classify the numerous sources of variability and uncertainty in model formulation, parameters and other inputs that arise from both natural variation in experimental data and lack of knowledge. The impact of uncertainty on the outputs of Cardiac Physiome models is not well understood, and this limits their utility as clinical tools. We argue that incorporating variability and uncertainty should be a high priority for the future of the Cardiac Physiome. We suggest investigating the adoption of approaches developed in other areas of science and engineering while recognising unique challenges for the Cardiac Physiome; it is likely that novel methods will be necessary that require engagement with the mathematics and statistics community. Abstract The Cardiac Physiome effort is one of the most mature and successful applications of mathematical and computational modelling for describing and advancing the understanding of physiology. After five decades of development, physiological cardiac models are poised to realise the promise of translational research via clinical applications such as drug development and patient-specific approaches as well as ablation, cardiac resynchronisation and contractility modulation therapies. For models to be included as a vital component of the decision process in safety-critical applications, rigorous assessment of model credibility will be required. This White Paper describes one aspect of this process by identifying and classifying sources of variability and uncertainty in models as well as their implications for the application and development of cardiac models. We stress the need to understand and quantify the sources of variability and uncertainty in model inputs, and the impact of model structure and complexity and their consequences for predictive model outputs. We propose that the future of the Cardiac Physiome should include a probabilistic approach to quantify the relationship of variability and uncertainty of model inputs and outputs.},,

	abstract = "Uncertainty and physiological variability are ubiquitous in cardiac electrical signaling. It is important to address the uncertainty and variability in cardiac modeling to provide reliable and realistic predictions of heart function, thus ensuring trustworthy computer-aided medical decision-making and treatment planning. Statistical techniques such as Monte Carlo (MC) simulations have been applied to uncertainty quantification and propagation in cardiac modeling. However, MC simulation-based methods are computationally prohibitive for complex cardiac models with a great number of parameters and governing equations. In this paper, we propose to use the Generalized Polynomial Chaos (gPC) expansion in combination with Galerkin projection to analytically quantify parametric uncertainty in ion channel models of mouse ventricular cell, and further propagate the uncertainty across different organizational levels of cell and tissue. To identify the most significant parametric uncertainty in cardiac ion channel and cell models, variance decomposition-based sensitivity analysis was first performed. Following this, gPC was integrated with deterministic cardiac models to propagate uncertainty through ion current, ventricular cell, 1D cable, and 2D tissue to account for the stochasticity and cell-to-cell variability. As compared to MC, the gPC in this work shows the superior performance in terms of computational efficiency. In addition, the gPC models can provide a measure of confidence in model predictions, which can improve the reliability of computer simulations of cardiac electrophysiology for clinical applications."
